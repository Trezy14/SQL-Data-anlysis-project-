# SQL-Data-anlysis-project-
SQL project on Analyzing International Debt Statistics

 The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories.
 Using postgresQSL, I'm going to find the answers to questions like:

What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?

Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?

What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

What country has the highest amount of principal repayments?

What is the most common debt indicator in which most countries owe their debt?

what is the maximum amount of debt that each country has?
