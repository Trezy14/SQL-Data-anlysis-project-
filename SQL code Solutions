*First to connect to the database where the table international_debt is residng, I had to SELECT all of the columns from the international_debt table.
Also, limited the output to the first ten rows to keep the output clean with the following line of code:

SELECT *
    FROM international_debt
    limit 10;

*It is importand I get a unique count of countries in the international_debt table so as to perform my statistical analysis holistically using 
the following line of code:

SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT Country_name) AS total_distinct_countries 
FROM international_debt;

*To get a sense of how the overall economy of the world is fairing, I had to find out the total amount of debt (in USD) that is owed by the different countries
using the next line of code:

SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(debt)/1000000, 2) AS total_debt
FROM international_debt;

*Next, to answer the question on the country with the highest debt, I used the line of code below and limited my querie to 1 which showed that China had the
debt debt totalling to 285793494734.20:

SELECT 
    country_name, 
    ROUND(sum(debt),2) AS total_debt
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY country_name
ORDER BY total_debt DESC 
LIMIT 1;

*I went further to find out on an average how much debt a country owes with the next line of code, as this give me a better sense of the distribution of the
amount of debt across different indicators.

SELECT 
    indicator_code AS debt_indicator,
    indicator_name,
    AVG(debt) AS average_debt
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY debt_indicator, indicator_name
ORDER BY average_debt DESC
limit 10;

 *Since the (DT.AMT.DLXF.CD) came out as the debt indicator with the higest debt profile, I investigate a bit more so as to find out which country owes the 
 highest amount of debt in the category of long term debts (DT.AMT.DLXF.CD).
 
 SELECT 
    country_name, 
    indicator_name
FROM international_debt
WHERE  debt = (SELECT 
                 MAX(debt)
             FROM international_debt
             WHERE indicator_code = 'DT.AMT.DLXF.CD');
             
*To get an idea on most common indicator in which the countries owe their debt, i wrote the following line of codes:

SELECT indicator_code, COUNT(indicator_code) AS indicator_count
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY indicator_code
ORDER BY indicator_count DESC, indicator_code DESC
LIMIT 20;

*Lastly I was able to find out the maximum amount of debt that each country has.

SELECT country_name, MAX(debt) AS maximum_debt
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY country_name
ORDER BY maximum_debt DESC
Limit 10;
